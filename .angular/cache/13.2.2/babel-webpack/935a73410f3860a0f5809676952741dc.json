After every session, anywhere in the world, players do discuss the game. Sometimes these discussions become heated because cricketers do take current form, performance, etc very seriously. But unfortunately, most of these discussions happen without any data as either the scoring is not done or is done on the paper-based scoresheet. Now it is impossible to aggregate data and get meaningful insights from scores recorded on paper. To solve this, we started using existing scoring apps but we were not happy with their UX and a lot of things were missing. At the same time, we did a little survey in our city and found that this is the problem for every cricketer. That's when the founder sat and designed a business plan for CricHeroes.
